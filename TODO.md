# Things to do.
## Complete the API
    More work to do with the current API:
    * Add benchmark tests
    * Implement From Vec for MyVec, which gives Vec into Myvec.
    * Macro with default/0 initialized vec.
    * Implement FromIterator.
    * Implement serialize, deserialize.
    * Send, Sync?
    * Return errors from operations that can fail.
## Integrate with TravisCI.
    * Run tests, benchmarks, build.
    * Figure kcov.
## New datastrutures
    * Deque? The new interest.
    * Simple nullable array vs circular buffer
    * Composable DS: LRU cache?
    * Hash, rebalance.. vector of vectors, constant search and insert times.
    * Set, can use derefmut methods internally?
